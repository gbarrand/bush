Linux</h1>
<p>You need : </p><pre class="fragment"> - a C++ compiler: g++ or clang++. In bush/use_cc, use_cpp, the default uses g++ for Linux.
   If having to tweak things, you have to follow the ${build_gnu} or ${build_clang}
   usage in these scripts and customize what is found within the corresponding "if".
 - zip to build the final binary kit file, but if not here tar is used.
 - ar, ranlib.
 - for graphics apps (most of them!), the X11 and OpenGL "devels" to have the .h headers files.
   (In general the run time .so shared libraries are already here).
</pre><p> and... that's all (folks). On most Linux distributions g++, zip, ar, ranlib, X11 and OpenGL are here. If not, install them with "sudo apt-get..." or "sudo yum..." according your Linux distribution, for example with something as: </p><pre class="fragment">    ubuntu&gt; sudo apt-get install libglu1-mesa-dev  # to have OpenGL .h.
 or on centos7:
    centos&gt; sudo yum install gcc gcc-c++
    centos&gt; sudo yum install zip unzip
    centos&gt; sudo yum install libX11-devel libXpm-devel libXft-devel libXext-devel
    centos&gt; sudo yum install mesa-libGL-devel mesa-libGLU-devel
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="bush_prerequisites_macOS"></a>
macOS</h1>
<p>In bush/use_cc, use_cpp, the default built for apps is to build with Cocoa, then the compiler (clang++) and Cocoa access (under /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/...) uses the one of a Xcode installation, then you have to install Xcode and the "Xcode command line tools" to build. If having to tweak things, you have to act within the "if" for ${buidl_sdk_mac} or ${build_sdk_mac_gnu}.</p>
<p>Note that if building a non Cocoa app (for example the X11 version of the pmx application), it is the build with clang (${build_clang}) which is used. </p><pre class="fragment">    macOS&gt; cd &lt;some_path&gt;/pmx/mgr
    macOS&gt; ./build  # it uses clang++ and put binaries in bin_sdk_mac.
    macOS&gt; open ./bin_sdk_mac/distrib/pmx/&lt;verions&gt;/pmx.app  # to run the Cocoa version.
    macOS&gt; ./build -x11 -bin_x11  # it uses clang++.
    macOS&gt; ./bin_x11/distrib/pmx/&lt;verions&gt;/bin/pmx  # to run the X11 version.
 or:
    macOS&gt; cd &lt;some_path&gt;/inlib/examples/cpp
    macOS&gt; ./build wroot.cpp
    macOS&gt; ./bin_clang/wroot
 or:
    macOS&gt; cd &lt;some_path&gt;/exlib/examples/cpp
    macOS&gt; ./build GL_X11.cpp
    macOS&gt; ./bin_clang/GL_X11
</pre><h1><a class="anchor" id="bush_prerequisites_windows"></a>
Windows-10</h1>
<p>On Windows-10 we build with VisualC++ (cl.exe) from a cygwin prompt. VisualC++ offers clearly the best performances at run time. (The cygwin/g++ is known to be a snail here and we did not tried to use clang++).</p>
<p>Then you need: </p><pre class="fragment"> - Visual Studio. We use the 2015 one.
 - cygwin with at least zip (bash is here by default). We installed git (to get code)
   and openssh (to log in and out to remote machines), and... it must be all.
</pre><p> If having to tweak bush/use_cc, use_cpp follow ${build_visual}. Note that the access to cl.exe to compile and link.exe to link is concentrated in the script bush/vc++. In particular all other build scripts (for example bush/compile_one_cpp) uses bush/vc++ with the same options than g++ and clang++ to declare include paths (-I), link path (-L), etc... The script bush/vc++ translates these to the /I, /L known by cl.exe, link.exe and does also the job to translate cygwin unix paths to Windows paths. </p>
